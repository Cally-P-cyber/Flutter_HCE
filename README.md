# NFC Host Card Emulation

this project uses the host card emulation feature of on android to copy an save and replay NDEF records.

It is still a work in progress and does not contain every intended feature yet some of wich are dont but not fully tested so they are sitting on my own servers.

This app does use firebase so if you want to use it you will need to set up a firebase account and follow their instructions on how to use the cli to initialize an application.
If enough people are interested I can make a version that does uses a local store instead.

If you want to support future development for this app or new ones you can donate at the link below:
